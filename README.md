# Stock-Market-Watchlist

Hi! 

[UPDATE] The APIs are out of date and I have not re-configured them yet. To see how the project ran **I highly recommend you watch the "market watch tutorial" video**. 

Market Watch is a web application that serves as a advanced watchlist for the stock market. Once making an account, you can see expert recommended stocks, add any stock (international included) to your watchlist, and view technical graphs to monitor their performance over time.

## Technical Details

To build the app, I used **Express JS, Node JS, EJS and CSS**. 

To get the latest financial data, I sourced my APIs from Yahoo Finance.

I also used a MongoDB Atlas database to store user details. In order to protect user privacy, I used **bcrypt** to encrypt user details before entering them into the database. 

## Future Aspirations

In the future, I would like to:

  1. Re-configure the APIs so they are up to date
  2. Make a notification system for share price movement
  3. Improve motion graphics for a cleaner UI and UX
